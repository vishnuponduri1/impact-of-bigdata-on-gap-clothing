# Gap Clothing Case Study Project

### Introduction & Business Case

Founded in 1969 by the Fishers, GAP Inc. revolutionized retailing. Despite being an iconic brand, declining sales prompted CEO changes. To revive the company, the then CEO Art Peck eliminated creative directors in 2015, shifting to a data-driven creative process. This case evaluates the decision's suitability and big data's role in marketing.

### Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of the strategic decision to shift to a data-driven creative process at GAP Inc. The analysis includes:

1. Evaluation of customer review ratings for different apparel brands, including GAP and its sister companies (Old Navy, Banana Republic).
2. Scraping and analysis of customer reviews to identify areas of improvement for Banana Republic.
3. Product level satisfaction analysis for GAP, comparing popular products with industry benchmarks (Amazon).
4. Hypothesis testing to assess GAP's performance against industry standards.
5. Investigation into successful product features using big data analytics.
6. Analysis of luxury brands' sales data and the role of big data in driving sales for high-end fashion.

### Key Findings

- The decision to eliminate creative directors and shift to a data-driven approach needs a nuanced approach, as observed in the analysis of luxury brands.
- Thrifty and fast-fashioned brands like GAP and Old Navy can benefit from a big data approach.
- A mix of big data analytics and creative input is crucial for creating unique selling points and brand identity.
